Read Me for Selection Sort

This was my first attempt to create an algorithm to sort an array using the selection sort method !

The project was based on a challenge from http://reprog.wordpress.com/2010/05/19/another-challenge-can-you-write-a-correct-selection-sort/

Future work on these files might include:
- trying to do the sort inside of a single array .
- adding additional tests to the text document .
- add arrays to texts
